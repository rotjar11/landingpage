        <h1>the "color" red</h1>
        <p>red is a rich color with an even richer history. Use of the pigment can be traced way back to Ancient Egypt where it was considered both a color of vitality and celebration, 
         as well as evil and destruction. From here on, red was a staple hue throughout history, used in ancient Grecian murals, in Byzantine clothing to signal status
         and wealth, and heavily applied throughout art movements ranging from the Renaissance through to modern day art.</p>
